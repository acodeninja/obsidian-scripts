To ensure\nreliable operations of such systems, comprehensive threat mod-\neling during system design and validation is of paramount\nsignificance. Previous works in literature mostly focus on safety,\nrisks and hazards in CPS but lack effective threat modeling\nnecessary to eliminate cyber vulnerabilities. Further, impact of\ncyber attacks on physical processes is not fully understood.\nThis paper presents a comprehensive threat modeling framework\nfor CPS using STRIDE, a systematic approach for ensuring\nsystem security at the component level. This paper first devises a\nfeasible and effective methodology for applying STRIDE and then\ndemonstrates it against a real synchrophasor-based synchronous\nislanding testbed in the laboratory. It investigates (i) what threat\ntypes could emerge in each system component based on the\nsecurity properties lacking, and (ii) how a vulnerability in a\nsystem component risks the entire system security. The paper\nidentifies that STRIDE is a light-weight and effective threat\nmodeling methodology for CPS that simplifies the task for\nsecurity analysts to identify vulnerabilities and plan appropriate\ncomponent level security measures at the system design stage.\n\nIndex  Terms—Cyber physical systems, smart grid,\nsynchrophasors, STRIDE, threat modeling, cyber security.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nCyber-Physical Systems (CPS) use Information and Com-\nmunication Technologies (ICT) to control and monitor the\nphysical processes. Critical infrastructures such as smart grids,\nindustrial control systems, transportation networks, water dis-\ntribution networks, etc are CPS where cyber vulnerabilities are\nconsidered very critical. The CPS are prone to cyber-attacks\non their data management and network layer as occurred in\nthe cyber attacks on Ukraine power distribution companies [1],\nGerman steel mill [2], Maroochy water breach [3] and various\nother industrial security incidents based on BlackEnergy and\nStuxnet [4], [5]. Thus, proper threat modeling for CPS in the\nsystem design process and incorporating necessary counter-\nmeasures are of paramount significance.\n\nThreat modeling is the identification of system vulnerabili-\nties and their potential impact on the physical processes. The\nsignificance of threat modeling for CPS can be realized by ap-\nplying against a particular system. This paper performs threat\nmodeling against a synchrophasor application. Synchrophasor\ntechnology is used for real-time monitoring, protection and\ncontrol in power systems [6]. It enables operators to track\npower system dynamics in real-time and promptly take actions\nwhenever necessary. Due to the nature of synchrophasor\n\napplications, cyber attacks could result in severe consequences\n\n[4].\n\nA. Related Work\n\nMost synchrophasor applications are still at a laboratory\nvalidation stage [6], [7]. Proper threat modeling at the early\nstage is essential to establish appropriate security measures for\nsynchrophasor applications before they are deployed in prac-\ntice. IEEE C37.118 is the most commonly used synchropha-\nsor communication framework by Phasor Measurement Units\n(PMUSs) and Phasor Data Concentrators (PDCs). However, it\nis highly vulnerable to cyber attacks due to no built-in security\nmechanism [8], [9], [10], [11]. Authors in [4] investigated\nhow vulnerabilities in synchrophasor-based systems can be\nexploited in the form of cyber attacks. Particularly, the au-\nthors have demonstrated attack scenarios for reconnaissance,\neavesdropping, Man-In-The-Middle (MITM), replay/reflection\nand denial of service attacks. Most researchers focused on a\nspecific attack type such as packet drop attacks [12], DoS\nattacks [13], data integrity attacks [14], GPS spoofing attacks\n[15], etc.\n\nVarious system safety and security modeling methodologies\nexist in literature e.g., STPA-sec (focuses on system safety)\n[16], HAZOP (focuses on hazard and system operability)\n[17], SAHARA (focuses on hazard, risk and security) [18],\nPASTA (focuses on process for attack simulation), OCTAVE\n(focuses on operationally critical threats and assets) [19],\nSTRIDE (focuses on identification of potential threats in each\nsubcomponent of the system) [20]. Although researchers have\npreviously analyzed threats for CPS in general, few have\nfocused on power systems. Authors in [21] presented STPA-\nSafeSec, an approach for security analysis that was tested\nagainst synchrophasor-based systems. However, their main\nfocus is safety, risks and hazards analysis.\n\nB. Motivation and Contributions\n\nSTPA-sec, HAZOP, OCTAVE and PASTA are complex\nmodeling methodologies with more focus on system safety\nand risks. This paper performs threat modeling using STRIDE\nwhich is comparatively a lightweight approach. The choice\nof STRIDE is motivated due to several reasons: (i) it is a\nsystematic approach and analyzes cyber threats against each\nsystem component based on its technical knowledge, (ii) it\nis comprehensive and analyzes security properties such as\n\nStep 8\n\np Stap & e §plan\nS Mitigation\nIdentify Strategies\nVulnerabilities\n\nStep &\nP Stap 2 o Analyze\nThreats in the\nStep & Plot DFD for N pro\nSystem\n\nDecompose Components\nSystem into\nComponents\n\nFigure 1. STRIDE-based threat modeling methodology.\n\nauthentication, authorization, confidentiality, integrity, non-\nrepudiation and availability against each system component,\nand (iii) it provides a clear understanding of the impact of a\ncomponent vulnerability on the entire system and helps ensure\nsystem security as the component level.\n\nThe literature still lacks an example framework showing the\napplication of the STRIDE approach to a CPS. Hence, the ob-\njective of this paper is to provide a walk-through demonstrat-\ning that the light-weight STRIDE approach can be applied to a\nCPS to produce an effective categorization of system-specific\nthreats. Specifically, it performs STRIDE-based threat mod-\neling against a real synchrophasor-based laboratory testbed\nwith the objective to establish appropriate security measures\nto secure the environment. Most synchrophasor applications\nare still in laboratory testing and validation; making STRIDE\nthe most effective cyber threats modeling approach.\n\nII. STRIDE METHODOLOGY\n\nThe STRIDE method is proposed by Microsoft and repre-\nsents a mnemonic for six different types of security threats\n[20]: (i) Spoofing: Masquerading of a legitimate user, process\nor system element, (ii) Tampering: Modification/editing of\nlegitimate information, (iii) Repudiation: Denying or disown-\ning a certain action executed in the system, (iv) Information\ndisclosure: Data breach or unauthorized access to confidential\ninformation, (v) Denial of Service (DoS): Disruption of service\nfor legitimate users, and (vi) Elevation of privilege: Getting\nhigher privilege access to a system element by a user with\nrestricted authority.\n\nSTRIDE analyzes vulnerabilities against each system com-\nponent which could be exploited by an attacker to compromise\nthe whole system. Due to the lack of a standard methodology,\nthis paper proposes five high-level steps (as shown in Fig.\n1) for applying STRIDE threat modeling against a system.\nThe first step is to decompose the system into its logical\nor structural components. Components can be internal pro-\ncesses/elements communicating internally within the system\nor external elements communicating with the system. The\nnext step is to plot a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) for each\nsystem component that visualizes its functionalities within or\nexternal to the system. The DFD uses four standard symbols:\n(i) External Entity (EE) ie., end-points of the system, (ii)\nProcess (P) i.e., units of functionality, (iii) Data Flow (DF) i.e.,\ncommunication data and (iv) Data Store (DS) i.e., database,\nlogs or file. The DFD may also contain trust boundaries which\n\nTable 1\nSUSCEPTIBILITY OF DFD ELEMENTS TO STRIDE THREATS.\n\nDFD Element s T R 1 D E\nEntity v’ v’\n\nData Flow NG v, v\n\nData Store v v v Vv\nProcess v v v v vV\n\nisolate trustworthy and untrustworthy elements. Each DFD\nelement type is susceptible to only a few or all STRIDE threats\nas shown in Table I [20]. The next step is to identify STRIDE\nthreats in the DFD of each system component. Based on\neach system component and its functionality, certain STRIDE\nthreats might not be applicable to it. Once threats have\nbeen identified for each system component, the vulnerabilities\ncausing them need to be investigated. The final step is to\nplan effective mitigation strategies based on the discovered\nvulnerabilities.\n\nSTRIDE-based threat modeling can be performed in two\npossible ways [22]: (i) STRIDE-per-element and (ii) STRIDE-\nper-interaction. STRIDE-per-element is more complex as it\nanalyzes behavior and operations of each system component.\nHowever, it may not be sufficient to identify certain threats that\nare not evident from the DFD. In certain scenarios, threats\nshow up in the interactions between system components.\nSTRIDE-per-interaction therefore enumerates threats against\nsystem interactions by considering tuples (origin, destination,\ninteraction). Comparatively, STRIDE-per-interaction is easier\nto perform and its protection strategies are normally enough\nto protect system (as cyber attacks normally involve malicious\ninteractions between system components).\n\nIII. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: SYNCHRONOUS ISLANDING\nUSE CASE\n\nSTRIDE-based threat modeling will now be performed for\na use case in the smart grid domain. Synchronous islanding\ndeals with distributed generation sources (e.g., microgrids) and\ntheir safe integration into the main grid. A microgrid is a cer-\ntain geographical area where generation (e.g., photovoltaics,\nwind farm, etc), load and storage are in close proximity.\nMicrogrids can operate either independently (usually for a\nlimited amount of time) or connected to the main grid.\nThe synchronous islanded operation enables microgrids to be\ndynamically connected or disconnected from the main grid.\nFor safe re-connection of a microgrid to main grid, it must be\nsynchronized with the main grid (i.e., same voltage magnitude,\nfrequency and phase angle). If a circuit breaker is closed in\nnon-synchronized state, it could cause severe physical damage\nto equipment (microgrid and/or main grid), risk to human\nsafety and loss of supply for the local consumers.\n\nThis paper performs threat modeling using a real laboratory\nbased synchronous islanding testbed. A high level view of the\ntestbed is shown in Fig. 2. The generator set consists of an\nalternator which is driven by prime mover (a DC machine in\nthis case). The prime mover controller increases/decreases the\n\nN\n_\n\nN\n=\n\nUtility Supply\n\nCommmaton — |\n\nFigure 2. Synchronous islanding use case.\n\ntorque on the drive shaft to the alternator, consequently the\nelectrical power output increases/decreases. PMUs measure\nelectrical quantities in real-time from both main grid (ie.,\nutility supply) and microgrid/generator set, and communicate\nsynchrophasor data to the controller. The controller adjusts the\nphase angle of the microgrid to synchronize it with the main\ngrid. Once synchronized, the circuit breaker can be closed\nsafely to connect the microgrid to the main grid. A detailed\ndescription of use case/testbed is available in our previous\nwork in [7]. The rest of the section performs STRIDE-based\nthreat modeling for the use case. Note, due to the space\navailable, the scope of this paper is limited to only the first\nfour steps as in Fig. 1.\n\nA. Decompose System into Components\n\nStep 1 (see Fig. 1) is to decompose system into its com-\nponents. Based on Fig. 2, the system consists of five compo-\nnents: PMU for main grid, PMU for microgrid, generator set,\ncontroller and circuit breaker. Note, threat analysis does not\nconsider physical components which are not susceptible to\ncyber attacks e.g., load, electrical wire connections between\ncircuit breaker and alternator or utility supply.\n\nB. Plot DFD for System Components\n\nAs in Fig. 1, step 2 in threat modeling is to plot a DFD\nfor each system component. Due to paper length restriction, a\nsingle DFD is plotted for the complete system (as in Fig. 3)\ninstead of plotting a separate DFD for each system component.\nNote, the PMUs in Fig. 2 are OpenPMUs [23] which consist of\nfour functional blocks: time source receiver, data acquisition,\nsignal processing and telecom. The time source receiver and\ndata acquisition functionalities are provided on a BeagleBone\nboard whereas, signal processing and telecom functionalities\nare provided on Raspberry Pi. Data acquisition component\ncommunicates with signal processing component using the\nUDP protocol. The telecom block restructures synchrophasor\ndata into IEEE C37.118 protocol format and sends to the\ncontroller. Since PMUs time-stamp real-time measurements\nusing a common precise time-source, the time source element\nis also depicted in the DFD (GPS in this case). The controller\n\nTable 11\nPOSSIBLE THREAT CONSEQUENCES (TC) BASED ON THE EXPERT\nKNOWLEDGE OF SYNCHRONOUS ISLANDING TESTBED.\n\nCode  Description Hazard\nTC-1  Circuit breaker closure in non-synchronized state.

Analyze Threats in the DFD\n\nTo perform threat analysis (step 3 in Fig. 1), it is necessary\nto first identify possible attacker intentions (or threat conse-\nquences) based on the expert knowledge of the system. For use\ncase in Fig. 2, Table II identifies possible threat consequences\nand assigns a code to each for referencing purpose. Fig.\n4 graphically represents STRIDE-per-element approach for\nthreat analysis. Its results are summarized in Table III and\nbriefly explained in the following.\n\n1) Spoofing: Precise timing information in the use case\nis critical for the controller to synchronize the microgrid to\nthe main grid. If the time source (EE-1 or EE-2 in Fig. 3)\nis spoofed by an attacker, the phase angle estimation (by P-\n3 or P-7) will be incorrect. This could result in destructive\nfailure if controller detects synchronization and closes the\ncircuit breaker (TC-1). Due to incorrect timing information,\nthe controller may fail to achieve synchronization (TC-4). If\ndisconnected microgrid cannot meet its local power demand,\nit could also result in blackout (TC-5). The attackers might\nspoof P-1 or P-5 to prevent system from acquiring timing\ninformation. This could result in TC-4 and TC-5. Spoofing\nof phasor estimation process (P-3 or P-7) and telecom process\n(P-4 or P-8) are critical as they can trick controller to assume\nsynchronization and close the circuit-breaker (TC-1). Spoofing\nof processes P-9 to P-12 could enable attacker to cause severe\ndamage to equipment or fail the entire synchronous islanding\nmechanism. E.g., safe limit for prime mover is analog signal\nbetween OV and 5V which could be violated by spoofing of\nP-10.\n\n2) Tampering: Tampering in the use case is very risky as\nthey could easily trick controller performing unsafe actions.\nIn Fig. 3, tampering attacks could easily take place on DF\nelements due to unencrypted communication. Particularly,\ntampering on DF-3 and DF-6 could trick controller to close\ncircuit breaker in non-synchronized state (TC-1). DF-2 and\nDF-5 are safe from tampering as they are not exposed to the\nnetwork and connected using secondary NICs on Raspberry\n\nTime Source\n\nController\n\nH Alternator\n\nDFD Elements:\nExternal Entity (EE) | ( Process (P} ) Data Flow (DF)\nD —\n\nData Store (DS}\n——\n\n1\nCoupled Prime-\nT Mover &\n\nTrust Boundary\n_____ |\n\nSignal Processing\n(Phasor\nEstimation\n\nADC Data\nAcquisition\n\ne\nepssarelines] | R, H\n1 PID Controller\n(RS TR £ P, ' ! !

Threat analysis using STRIDE-per-element approach.\n\nPi and BeagleBone. Tampering on DF-7 could provide unsafe\ninput to prime mover (TC-2) and damage the generator set.\nTampering on DF-8 could also result in TC-1. Tampering on\nDS-2 and DS-4 (which contain necessary configuration infor-\nmation related to IEEE C37.118 communication framework)\ncould prevent PMUs from communicating with controller or\nsend incorrectly formated packets to controller (TC-9). Not\nonly DF and DS elements, tampering could also take place on\nprocesses (P) if they are compromised by an attacker and are\nequally risky as DF elements.\n\n3) Repudiation: Non-repudiation cannot be guaranteed for\neach DFD element in Fig. 3 due to very high synchrophasor\ndata transmission rate (i.e., 100 packets/second). This will\nrequire huge amount of storage at each DFD element for\nlogging activities or recording events. Instead, non-repudiation\nshould be ensured for command and system critical messages\n(which might be injected by attackers). E.g., P-4 and P-8 are\n\nsusceptible to repudiation attacks because there is no logging\nof IEEE C37.118 command and configuration messages. Fur-\nther, P-9, P-10 and P-12 are also susceptible to repudiation\nattacks.\n\n4) Information disclosure: Information disclosure attacks\nin the use case are not risky themselves but could reveal\nsystem critical information to attackers which could be used\nin more complex attacks. DF-1 to DF-6 in Fig. 3 may not be\nthe target elements for attacker as information disclosure here\nwill be of no much use. E.g., GPS timing is globally available\nand attacker does not need to execute information disclosure\nattack for it. The most obvious targets for attacker will be\nDF-7 and DF-8 which will provide attacker the information\non generator set and status of circuit breaker, respectively.\nInformation disclosure attacks of DS-2 and DS-4 could reveal\nattacker the configurations of IEEE C37.118 communication\nframework. Processes are especially susceptible to information\ndisclosure attacks e.g., P-4 and P-8 (how synchrophasor data\nis encoded in IEEE C37.118 packets), P-9 (when microgrid is\nsynchronized or non-synchronized with main grid), P-10 (what\nadjustment is made to generator set), etc.\n\n5) Denial Of Service: DoS attacks could interrupt power\nsupply for microgrid consumers. If the microgrid is in discon-\nnected state and cannot meet local demand, a DoS attack could\nprevent it from synchronizing and connecting to the main grid.\nThus, blackout could result for microgrid local consumers.\nMost DFD elements in Fig. 3 are susceptible to DoS attack;\n\nTable 111\nTHREAT MODELING USING STRIDE-PER-ELEMENT METHODOLOG Y.\n\nTable 1V\nTHREAT MODELING USING STRIDE-PER-INTERACTION METHODOLOGY.\n\nSTRIDE __ DFD Elements TC Interaction s T R 1 D E\ns TC4, TC-5 P-9 to P4: JEEE C37.118 command messay x oxox ox  x x\nTC-1.

Identify Vulnerabilities\n\nIdentification of vulnerabilities (step 4 in Fig. 1) is essential\nR for planning effective security measures. Spoofing of processes\n(P-1 - P-12) could take place due to lack of authentication\n\nI - i\nbetween communicating processes. E.g., P-10 sends simple\nUDP packets to P-11. Due to lack of authentication, P-11\nD cannot verify if it has received packets from legitimate P-\n10. Similarly, communication between P-4 and P-9 is based\non IEEE C37.118 protocol which also lacks authentication.\nFurther, processing of IEEE C37.118 commands by P-4 and P-\n8 is not based on sender; they can process commands received\nE from any device (not only P-9). Depending on time source, EE-\n\nhowever, the most likely and easy targets could be DF-3,\nDF-6 to DF-8, P-9 and P-12. To execute DoS attack against\na process, attacker would normally flood the process with\nsuperfluous traffic to consume its processing resources and\nprevent it from processing legitimate requests. If an attacker\nhas compromised the physical device, he may stop the process.\nComparatively, DoS attacks could be easily executed against\nDF elements by simply dropping the packets.\n\n6) Elevation of privilege: Elevation of privilege means a\nhigh privilege activity performed by a less privileged user. In\nthe use case, no authorization or privilege levels are defined\nfor processes. Thus, a process will perform the task requested\nby a legitimate user/element or the attacker. E.g., P-4 and P-8\ncannot verify if IEEE C37.118 command messages received\nfrom a legitimate user and may provide configurations to\nan attacker. Due to no authorization, P-9 processes received\nsynchrophasor data from any device. P-12 cannot verify au-\nthenticity of received commands and may close circuit breaker\nin non-synchronized state (TC-1).\n\nTable IV presents threat analysis using STRIDE-per-\ninteraction methodology that takes into account all interactions\ntaking place in the testbed. It can be observed in Table IV\nthat two elements (e.g., P-4 and P-9) could have different\ntypes of interactions where each interaction type could be\nsusceptible to different STRIDE threats. E.g., IEEE C37.118\ncommand messages are susceptible to all STRIDE threats\nwhereas data messages could be susceptible to tampering,\ninformation disclosure and DoS attacks.\n\n1 and EE-2 can also be spoofed due to lack of authentication.\n\nTampering on all DF elements (except DF-3 and DF-6) is\ndue to lack of integrity verification mechanism. Even though,\nDF-3 and DF-6 have checksum to verify integrity, they are\nstill susceptible to tampering threats. It is due to the fact that\nIEEE C37.118 checksum is non-cryptographic and is based\non predefined algorithm. Thus, attackers can easily modify\npackets, calculate new checksum and include in the packets\nwhich will go undetected by P-9. Also processes (P-1 - P-\n12) are susceptible to tampering due to lack access control\nmechanism.\n\nThere is no event logging and recording mechanism in the\nuse case. Thus, the processes are susceptible to repudiation\nthreats and cannot deny or track past events. The information\ndisclosure threats to DF elements is due to lack of encryption.\nUnencrypted messages can be easily decoded and interpreted\nby attackers. Further, P and DS elements are susceptible\nto information disclosure threats due to lack of appropriate\naccess control mechanism. The use case lacks redundancy of\nelements as well as authentication and authorization between\nelements, they are susceptible to DoS threats. If processes\nhave authentication and process packets received only from\nauthenticated senders, they could significantly save their pro-\ncessing resources. Also elevation of privilege threats are linked\nwith authorization. The testbed processes are susceptible to\nelevation of privilege threats due to lack of access control\nbased on authorization.\n\nIV. DIsCcussioN\n\nThere is no standard methodology defined in literature\nfor applying STRIDE. Thus, this paper proposed five steps\n(see Fig. 1) which were identified as a basis to effectively\n\nperform STRIDE-based threat modeling. It was observed that\ncertain STRIDE threats impact a group of DFD elements.\nSpoofing and tampering are especially critical and they impact\nthe operations of other elements (particularly in the physical\ndomain) resulting in more severe consequences for the system.\nFurther, STRIDE helped to identify that the attacker can\nachieve a specific malicious objective in various ways. E.g.,\nattacker can achieve TC-1 through spoofing of P-4, P-8, EE-\n1, EE-2 etc or through tampering on DF-3, DF-6, etc (see\nTable III). This helps analysts to developed more appropriate\nsecurity solutions.\n\nSTRIDE-per-element analysis in Section III-C highlighted\nthe significance of securing the system at the component level.\nIt was observed that entire system security can only be ensured\nif all of its components are secure. However, it was identified\nthat STRIDE-per-element approach may not be sufficient to\nidentify certain threats due to inadequate technical knowledge\nof system components or if threats appear only in interactions\n(e.g., P-4 and P-9 in Table IV). Thus, STRIDE-per-interaction\nshould also be considered to complement threat analysis and\nplan more effective security measures.\n\nIt was revealed in Section III-D that each STRIDE threat\nin the use case is due to lack of certain security properties.\nFor analysts to plan mitigation strategies, the six essential se-\ncurity properties (authorization, authentication, confidentiality,\nintegrity, availability and non-repudiation) should be ensured\nfor each system component.\n\nV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nSecurity of cyber physical systems is of paramount signifi-\ncance as they are ubiquitous in critical infrastructures. Previous\nworks in literature mostly focused on safety, risk and hazard\naspects in cyber physical systems [16], [17], [18], [21]. Few\nresearchers have analyzed threats for cyber physical systems\n[24] but lack a comprehensive mechanism for ensuring system\nsecurity at the component level.\n\nThis paper presented a comprehensive STRIDE-based threat\nmodeling for cyber physical systems. The primary contribution\nof the paper is to formalize a systematic methodology that\ncan be used for effective characterization of system-specific\nthreat using the STRIDE approach. This is demonstrated by\nperforming threat modeling against a real laboratory based\nsynchronous islanding testbed. The paper presented necessary\nmapping of STRIDE threats to the system components using\nthe DFD. Due to inter-dependencies between system com-\nponents, the entire system security can only be ensured by\naddressing vulnerabilities of each system component. Thus,\nthis paper identified STRIDE as an effective approach towards\nensuring system security at the component level.\n\nThe paper demonstrated that an attacker can achieve a\nspecific malicious objective by exploiting threats at different\nlocations in the system. By identifying component level vul-\nnerabilities and their potential physical consequences, STRIDE\ncan also effectively cope with such challenges. The results of\nSTRIDE approach are more meaningful, easily understandable\nand comprehensive enough for system designers in order to\n\ndevelop appropriate security solutions. The output of STRIDE\ncan feed into risk analysis processes to establish the most\ncritical threats and furthermore the development of the most\nappropriate mitigation measures that should be applied.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nThis work was funded by the EPSRC CAPRICA project\n(EP/M002837/1).\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1]1 R.M.
